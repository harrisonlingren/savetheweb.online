		<h1>Fight for Net Neutrality</h1>
		<h3>This could be your last chance to stop ISPs from messing up your Internet.</h3>
		<p>The FCC is about to announce a vote to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon 
		and Comcast to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see &amp; do online. 
		Once they announce the vote, it's hard to stop. But if we flood them with calls and messages now, 
		<i>Congress</i> can stop the vote.</p>

		<h2>Contact Congress in 5 minutes with ResistBot</h2>

		<p><a href="https://resistbot.io"><b>ResistBot</b></a> is an easy way to contact your local representatives about 
		issues that matter <b>in just 5 minutes</b>. Here's the steps you need to take to 
		contact your representatives about Net Neutrality:

		<ol>
			<li><a href="sms:50409?body=resist"><b>Text "resist"</b></a> to 50409</li>
			<li>The bot will ask for your name. <b>Text back with your first and last name.</b></li>
			<li>Next, your local address. <b>Respond with your street address + ZIP code</b> (1234 Main Street 43092)</li>
			<li>Once your address is confirmed, it will share the names of your representatives. <b>Text "congress"</b> 
			to send a message to all of your representatives.</li>
			<li>Next it will ask for the message you want to send. Here's a brief message in text-sized chunks that you can copy-and-paste and send:
				<p id="text1"> <span class="copy" data-clipboard-target="#text1 .text">Copy</span> <span class="text">Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.</span> </p>
				<p id="text2"> <span class="copy" data-clipboard-target="#text2 .text">Copy</span> <span class="text">Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day.</span> </p>
				<p id="text3"> <span class="copy" data-clipboard-target="#text3 .text">Copy</span> <span class="text">The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture.</span> </p>
				<p id="text4"> <span class="copy" data-clipboard-target="#text4 .text">Copy</span> <span class="text">Please stand with the public by upholding the FCC's Title II Net Neutrality protections once and for all.</span> </p>
			</li>
			<li>Once the above has been sent, <b>text "done"</b> to confirm your message.
			<li>Finally, once the message has been confirmed, <b>text "send"</b> to finish and send your message
			or <b>text "preview"</b> to make sure the bot saved it correctly.</li>
		</ol>

		Once it's been sent, you're good to go! I would recommend sending messages as often as you can - the easiest way 
		for average Americans to influence their legislators is to make their phones ring off the hook. Interns and 
		staffers make notes of the viewpoints of constituents who call in and pass that information along, and internal 
		tallies of the positions taken in those calls do affect their decisions. The more calls and the more lopsided the 
		tally, the more likely senators are to be influenced.</p>
